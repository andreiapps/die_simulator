# Die Simulator
Die Simulator is a mobile app that simulates a die. I might add more features and make it better.

To run the project locally, clone the repository, install the kivy Python module and run the app with python by executing "python main.py" or "python3 main.py" from the project directory.

If you want to build it, clone the repo, install kivy and use a tool such as [Buildozer](https://github.com/kivy/buildozer) to build the app for Android or iOS.
