# Die Simulator
Die Simulator is an app that simulates a die. I might add more features and make it better.

To run the project locally, clone the repository, run "pip install kivy" for MacOS or Windows and "sudo pip3 install kivy" for Linux(some distribuitions such as Arch Linux require you to run something different such as "pacman -S python-kivy" on Arch Linux), then type "python main.py" for Windows or "python3 main.py" for Linux or MacOS to run the app

If you want to build it, do the steps above and use a tool such as buildozer to build the app for Android or iOS.
